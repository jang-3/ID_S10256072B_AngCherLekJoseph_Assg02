# Interbarter

### Goal: To help users of Interbarter transfer their furniture and pay/receive their due Clover coins, as well as to portray the company in a good light through the landing page. 

## Introduction 

In today’s day and age, furniture is a necessary amenity in our homes, offices, and buildings. However, as the usage of furniture increases, so too does its wastage. Initially wanted and used furniture becomes unwanted, and eventually gets disposed of, regardless of the current condition it is in.
Sometimes, furniture of perfectly fine or functional quality is unwanted and also discarded. This is considered to be a wastage, because there may be other external individuals, families, or groups who might need it, more often than not.

One of the proposed reasons could be that some individuals lack the connections to give away their furniture, and resort to throwing it away because no one in their immediate vicinity requires it.

Another reason could be that some individuals desire to dispose of the furniture immediately due to their own individual circumstances. Because giving it away requires external arrangements that may take time and effort, individuals may not wish to go through the trouble as it is more efficient for them to throw it away.

Lastly, some individuals may also choose to recycle the furniture as a form of disposal. While this method does attempt to prevent typical wastage, it is not as efficient as transferring it directly to another party for immediate use, rather than taking the time to manufacture another product using the aforementioned recycled furniture.

At Interbarter, we create a service that aims to cover all three of these reasons, to provide a convenient service to transfer and reuse furniture easily, and provide incentives for you to do so.

### What is Interbarter?

The name ‘Interbarter’ is made of two parts : ‘Inter’ meaning ‘between’, and ‘barter’ meaning ‘trade’. Together, ‘Interbarter’ forms a meaning : ‘to trade between users’.

Interbarter is an online service that allows users to put up their furniture for purchase in unique coins. These coins then allow the user to purchase other furniture according to its price.

Commonly, the term ‘barter’ means ‘to trade without currency’. In Interbarter, our vision is to create a localised system of its own, largely apart from money. This is because the product of exchange is intentionally unwanted furniture, and as such, using real currency to purchase unwanted furniture is counterproductive because it makes buyers more cautious and less open to purchasing items.

To fix this issue, we introduced a false currency that we call ‘Clover Coins’. We use the symbol of a clover to connote good will, love, and fortune.
These clover coins are the main currency used in the selling and purchase of goods in Interbarter. By this use of a false currency that is mostly detached from money, we fulfill our vision of creating a bartering system motivated by kindness.

This use of a false currency distinguishes Interbarter from other similar platforms for purchasing furniture.
Still, while Clover Coins cannot be converted into money, we will not stop users from exchanging their real money into Clover Coins should they wish to.

Interbarter facilitates trades by collecting your furniture physically and storing it at a storage facility. From these storage facilities, there will be a span of 5 years where it remains inside. This allows the users to have a convenient experience by putting their furniture up for sale without putting much effort in on their side.

Within this span of 5 years, the furniture may be purchased for the amount of Clover Coins put as the price. When 5 years is up, the furniture will be recycled, and coins will not be given. For this reason, Interbarter would have close partnerships with other recycling companies within Singapore as an avenue for earning, which in turn allows us to carry out our services. Should any furniture be purchased, it will be physically delivered to you conveniently on a set date.

After a successful purchase, users may leave reviews regarding the recent purchase. Because Interbarter trades second-hand furniture, only the purchaser may leave a review (?/5 Stars) on that furniture. That review will then be put publicly on the owner’s profile for all to see. This review will also add to the seller’s average stars per item sold, as well as contribute to that user’s reputation points. Reputation points are a byproduct of the rate of purchase and the total stars earned, which tells other viewers how well rated this seller is. 

## Design Process

### Target Audience
Because Interbarter is a platform for trading furniture, and furniture is a universal amenity, our target audience is wide. However, we imagine it will be catered more specifically towards families, due to how common families are and the necessity of furniture within families. 


### Colour Choice
The brand colour of interbarter is dark green, which is intended to evoke a calm feeling, and carries tones of renewal and recycling. Green is the colour of life, and the goal of Interbarter is to “Give furniture new life”. 

### Logo
The logo is comprised of a monogram from a lowercase i and an uppercase N. The dot on the lowercase i represents the item, and the uppercase N represents how the item travels from the bottom left corner of the N to the top left corner of it — travelling from one party to another. 

### Font Choice
The font chosen is Poppins, a minimalistic and clean font which fits the feel of Interbarter, and intended to portray a modern and trustable website.
